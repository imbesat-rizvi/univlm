It is an extension of classical mechanics that takes into account the uncertainty principle, which states that it is impossible to simultaneously know both the position and momentum of a particle with arbitrary precision. The main features of quantum mechanics are: 1. Wave-particle duality: Particles can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties, depending on their state. 2. Superposition."
